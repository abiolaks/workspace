Ted Talk: Grit by Angela DuckWork

Grit is passion and perseverance for long term growth
it is having stamina, it is sticking with your future day in day out.
not just for the week not month but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality
Grit is living life like it is a marathon and not a sprint
talent does not make you gritty. it is unrelated to talent.

To build Grit is the growth mindset: the ability to learn is not fixed and change with effort. it is great for building grit.

Grit is the number 1 predictor of success, more than any other factor
